Used the example from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-configure-using-wsb-file?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-4020472
The example file was not working, and kinda basic. Added some folders that can be nice to have, c:\Temp with write and Downloads folder with only read for access to downloaded stuff
